## Hi there!

Hello! 👋🏻 My name is Andrew Sabourin, and I am attending Clark College for my Web Development AA to then pursue a BAS in Cybersecurity. 
I have a large interest in decision-making, note capturing, AI, and much more! If I am not at my computer, I am either reading about 
history, philosophy, being outdoors when permitted, and playing Skyrim.
